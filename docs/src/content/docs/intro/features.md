- 📊 [Export metrics](/integrations/metrics) in Prometheus format with proxy status and latency information

- 🌓 Web interface with dark/light theme for monitoring all proxy endpoints status

  - 🔍 Search and filter proxies by name or status
  - 📊 Sort by name, latency, or status
  - 🗂️ Grouped, collapsible view for balancer/subscription groups
  - 🔄 Auto-refresh without page reload
  - 🎨 [Full customization](/configuration/web-customization) — custom logo, styles, or entire template
